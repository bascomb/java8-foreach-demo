Create a Collection of Strings.
Print all elements using for-each and for-in.
Compare performance in multithreaded environment.
For-each should allow concurrency. Multiple threads
executing on different elements since order is not important. 
For-in is imperative programming..restricting Java to iterate through the collection and not run concurrent threads.
